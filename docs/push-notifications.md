# Push Notifications

## Desktop (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
1. Open the app.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Scroll to **Notification Preferences**.
4. Click **Enable Push Notifications**.
5. Allow permission when prompted.

## iPhone / iPad (iOS 16.4+)
Due to Apple's restrictions, push notifications only work when the app is installed to your Home Screen.

1. Open the app in **Safari**.
2. Tap the **Share** button (box with arrow).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Launch the app from your Home Screen.
5. Go to **Settings**.
6. You will now see the **Enable Push Notifications** button (instead of instructions).
7. Tap it and allow permission.

## Troubleshooting
- **No button on iPhone?**: Ensure you are running iOS 16.4 or later and have added the app to your Home Screen.
- **Not receiving notifications?**: Check your system settings (Notifications > Reminders App) and ensure "Allow Notifications" is on.
- **Double notifications?**: If you have the app open on multiple screens, you might see a toast and a system notification. This is normal behavior to ensure you never miss a reminder.
